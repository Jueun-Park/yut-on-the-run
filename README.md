# yut-on-the-run

Single-player Korean Yut board game prototype built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
pnpm run lint
pnpm run build
```

## What to do next

- Set up Tailwind CSS (NEXT_STEPS.md, Milestone 1.2) so we can style the UI quickly.
- Scaffold the engine modules (board, rules, state, rng, rewards) using `mvp-spec.md` as the source of truth.
- Replace the placeholder components in `src/components` and wire the UI to the engine as it lands.

More detail and the full roadmap live in `NEXT_STEPS.md` and `mvp-spec.md`.
